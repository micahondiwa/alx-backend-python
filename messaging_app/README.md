# Building Robust APIs with DRF

## Objectives 

- Scaffold a Django project using industry-standard project structures.
- Identify, define, and implement scalable data models using Django’s ORM.
- Establish one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one relationships between models.
- Create clean and modular Django apps.
- Set up and configure URL routing for APIs using Django’s path and include functions.
- Follow best practices in file structure, code organization, and documentation.
- Build a maintainable API layer using Django REST Framework (optional enhancement).
- Validate and test APIs with real data using tools like Postman or Swagger.

## Implementation Phases 

1. Project Setup and Environment Configuration
- Create a virtual environment
- Install Django
- Scaffold the project with django-admin startproject and python manage.py startapp
- Configure settings.py (INSTALLED_APPS, middleware, CORS, etc.)

2. Defining Data Models
- Identify core models based on requirements (e.g., User, Property, Booking)
- Use Django ORM to define model classes
- Add field types, constraints, and default behaviors
- Apply migrations and use Django Admin for verification

3. Establishing Relationships
- Implement foreign keys, many-to-many relationships, and one-to-one links
- Use related_name, on_delete, and reverse relationships effectively
- Use Django shell to test object relations

4. URL Routing
- Define app-specific routes using urls.py
- Use include() to modularize routes per app
- Follow RESTful naming conventions: /api/properties/, /api/bookings/<id>/
- Create nested routes when necessary

5. Best Practices and Documentation
- Use views.py to separate logic and ensure Single Responsibility
- Document endpoints using README or auto-generated documentation tools
- Keep configuration settings modular (e.g., using .env or settings/ directory structure)
        Use versioned APIs (e.g., /api/v1/) to future-proof development
